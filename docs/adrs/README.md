# Architectural Decision Records

This directory records **why** a concrete architectural decision was made: the alternatives
considered, the trade-offs accepted, and the findings that forced a choice. It complements, and is
deliberately separate from, the [architectural specs](../architecture/README.md) which answer
**how** the system is built and link back to these ADRs rather than restating their reasoning.

## Conventions

- **One file per decision**, at `NNNN-slug.md`, numbered zero-padded and monotonically increasing.
  Numbers are **never reused**. New records append to the end of the sequence regardless of which
  architecture section they support.
- Start new records with `cargo xtask new-adr "<decision>" --decided-by <value>`, which fills
  [`0000-template.md`](0000-template.md), takes the next number, and adds the index row.
- **Decided by** is the name of the person who decided, `agent, ratified by <who>`,
  or `agent, unratified`: so it is clear who signed off on each decision.
  `cargo xtask new-adr --decided-by human` fills in the name from `git config user.name`.
- **Status** is `Accepted` or `Superseded by ADR-NNNN`. A record is never deleted or edited to
  reverse its own decision — write a new record and mark the old one superseded.
- Link related records with `[ADR-NNNN](NNNN-slug.md)`; link back to the section under
  [`docs/architecture/`](../architecture/README.md) that the decision supports.
